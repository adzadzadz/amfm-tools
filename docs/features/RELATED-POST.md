# Related Posts By Keywords

## Overview & Details

Note: want this module for all 3 sites. Start with AMFM

I'd like to create a template to show 3-6 small content cards as "Related Articles" that follow the following logic evaluated from top to bottom as if statement and at any point count is 6, stop trying to find more matches:

1. Page or post has same ACF keyword values  
2. Page or post contains at least 1 same ACF keyword value  
3. Page or post shares same parent

Looks like this without any post date or anything. Order by most recently edited.

Mobile shows 3 max slim cards but have all 6 in DOM.  

**How it will be used**  
Add this to the footer and show it only for blogs and low intent pages (still trying to sort out how exactly to sort low from high intent programmatically)  
If this isn't showing then show a high intent menu there.

## Goals

* Improve Internal Linking for SEO & CRO purposes  
* Increase site engagement
